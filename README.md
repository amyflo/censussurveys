# Census Survey Explorer

## Description
Discover U.S. Census Bureau surveys or censuses by filtering and searching by geography, frequency, topics, and subtopics. Created for the U.S. Census Bureau as a tool that allows users to filter, search, and locate surveys easily as part of my extension for the 2020 Civic Digital Fellowship.

### Background
This project was created as part of my extension from the Civic Digital Fellowship by Coding it Forward (Summer Cohort '20). Designed as a reference tool as an alternative for the U.S. Census Bureau's [List of All Surveys & Programs](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/surveys-programs.html), this project first started as a data visualization project that transformed into its current version. 

### Features
- Use geography, frequency, topic, and subtopic dropdowns to filter through surveys
- Search by keyword or survey name for relevant surveys
- View support pages for more information and background on Census surveys
- Mobile-responsive layouts: use this tool wherever you want

### Alternatives: 
- [Explore Census Data](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/): Finding datasets and using the Census API
- [List of All Surveys & Programs](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/surveys-programs.html): The foundation for this project

## Deployment
To deploy this app, use [Parcel](http://parceljs.org) with the command `parcel index.html --public-url ./" which will launch a deployable version in the dist folder in your branch. Then, move a copy of those files to the gh-pages branch and push the commits to deploy!

## Authors and acknowledgment
