# censussurveys
Census Survey Explorer that updates cards and allows users to filter through different surveys easily. 

This project was created for the U.S. Census Bureau as part of my internship as a Civic Digital Fellow. 

The project uses the Isotope API in order to filter by search and checkboxes (styled as buttons) through a database of different Census Bureau surveys.
