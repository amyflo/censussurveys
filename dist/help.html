          <p class="card-text">
            The Census Survey Explorer is a useful tool to help you find which survey
            may have the information you need. You can use the search bar or the

            subtopics you are interested in.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            All program and survey listings will take you to their respective
            website where you can find more information about the
            program/survey. For example, contact info, data, news releases, and
            more.

          <h5 class="card-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h5>
          <h6 class="card-title">
            Why does the search bar not produce the survey results I would
            expect?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            The search bar works best when using specific keywords only found in
            in this tool. It is not able to function as a traditional search
            engine. It is sensitive to spelling. Please use the all the guidance
            pages for suggested search terminology.
          </p>

          <h6 class="card-title">
            Why can I not find my specific state (ex. Maryland)?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            Please use the dropdown filter under geographies “State”, navigate
            to your survey of interest, and then access data from there or using
            our data tools.
          </p>
          <h6 class="card-title">
            Where can I find Decennial data for previous year data not available
            in data.census.gov or other Census data tools?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            You can visit the Decennial Census by the Decade webpage to view and
            access previous Decennial Census data and information.
          </p>
          <h6 class="card-title">
            Why doesn’t a particular survey or program appear when selecting
            certain topics/subtopics I know were part of a survey?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            Many surveys and programs have changed over time. The Census Survey
            Explorer only provides filters for current topics/subtopics related
            to a particular survey or program.
          </p>
          <h6 class="card-title">
            Now that I know what survey(s) have the data I am looking for, where
            do I go to find the data?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            You can visit the survey webpage directly by clicking on a survey
            name or you can visit our Data Tools and Apps webpage. Not all
            surveys publish their data the same way. Some survey webpages will
            direct you to the appropriate data tool(s) and others will provide
            direct links to data tables (csv files), reports, and more.
          </p>
          <h6 class="card-title">Can I select multiple boxes at a time?</h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            Yes! You can select multiple selections within a dropdown list as
            well as across multiple dropdowns. For example, you can select
            National and State geographies as well as Economic and Business
            topics.
          </p>

          <h6 class="card-title">
            How do I know what topic terms to use when I search?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            We provided a list of available subtopics for you to look use while
            using the subtopic dropdown or the search bar. The search bar can
            find words in the survey descriptions. Please use the topics page
            for guidance. For example, if you use the search bar for the term
            “car” it may not pull up all the applicable surveys, but the topics
            page informs you that the subtopic “vehicle” is the best subtopic
            term to use to find the most applicable surveys.
          </p>

          <h6 class="card-title">
            How do I use the topics and subtopics dropdowns?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            This is a <a href="/topics.html" target="_blank">list of subtopics</a> found across all of our listed surveys.
            As detailed here, subtopics are categorized under five broad topics,
            which represent the types of surveys we conduct. Use this subtopic
            list to help you find the right subtopic search term that relates to
            your subject matter of interest. (For example, if interested in
            “cars”, find that the subtopic term “vehicle” is best). To use the
            Census Survey Explorer by subtopic, find a subtopic in the subtopic
            dropdown or type it into the search bar to find the survey(s) that
            has your subject matter of interest.
          </p>

          <h6 class="card-title">
            What do I do if I don’t see the geography I need in the dropdown?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            There are many geographies, if you cannot find your geography,
            select “Other” and try to use other filters, such as topic and
            subtopics, to narrow your search. See the geography guidance page to
            see what was included under “Other”.
          </p>

          <h6 class="card-title">
            Why can't I find data for all the years of a survey?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            Some surveys have been changed or combined into other program areas
            over time and therefore, only the most recent data is available.
