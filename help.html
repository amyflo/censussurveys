          <p class="card-text">
            No matter what your experience level is, the Census Census Survey
            Explorer is a useful tool to help discover which survey may have the
            information you need. Use the dropdown lists to select geographies,
            frequencies, topics, or subtopics you are interested in or use the
            search bar to find a survey based on a keyword.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            The filters you select are displayed. To clear all the filters and
            start a new search, click on “Reset Search.”
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            Clicking on a program and survey listing will take you to its
            respective website where you can find more information about the
            program/survey such as links to data tools, data tables, contact
            information, respondent information, news releases, and more.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            What makes the Census Survey Explorer unique is that it is a
            reference for all our surveys/censuses in one place and a guide that
            can help you figure out if there is data available and where it may
            be found across all of the Census Bureau’s surveys and censuses.

          <h6 class="card-title">
            Why does the search bar not produce the survey results I would
            expect?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            The search bar works best when using specific keywords only found in
            in this tool. It is not able to function as a traditional search
            engine. It is sensitive to spelling. Please use the all the guidance
            pages for suggested search terminology.
          </p>

          <h6 class="card-title">
            Why can I not find my specific state (ex. Maryland)?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            Please use the geographies dropdown filter, select “State”, click on
            to your survey of interest, and then access data from there or using
            our data tools.
          </p>
          <h6 class="card-title">
            Where can I find Decennial data for previous year data not available
            in data.census.gov or other Census data tools?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            You can visit the
            <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/decade.2010.html" target="_blank">Decennial Census by the Decade webpage</a>
            to view and access previous Decennial Census data and information.
          </p>
          <h6 class="card-title">
            Why doesn’t a particular survey or program appear when selecting
            certain topics/subtopics I know were part of a survey?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            Many surveys and programs have changed over time. The Census Survey
            Explorer only provides filters for current topics/subtopics related
            to a particular survey or program.
          </p>
          <h6 class="card-title">
            Now that I know what survey(s) have the data I am looking for, where
            do I go to find the data?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            You can visit the survey webpage directly by clicking on a survey
            name or you can visit our
            <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/data-tools.html" target="_blank">Data Tools and Apps</a>
            webpage. Not all surveys publish their data the same way. Some
            survey webpages will direct you to the appropriate data tool(s) and
            others will provide direct links to data tables (csv files),
            reports, and more.
          </p>
          <h6 class="card-title">Can I select multiple boxes at a time?</h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            Yes! You can select multiple selections within a dropdown list as
            well as across multiple dropdowns. For example, you can select
            "national" and "state" geographies as well as "economic" and
            "business" topics.
          </p>

          <h6 class="card-title">
            How do I know what topic terms to use when I search?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            We provided a list of available subtopics for you to use while using
            the subtopic dropdown or the search bar. The search bar can find
            words in the survey descriptions. Please use the topics page for
            guidance. For example, if you use the search bar for the term “car”
            it may not pull up all the applicable surveys, but the topics page
            informs you that the subtopic “vehicle” is the best subtopic term to
            use to find the most applicable surveys.
          </p>

          <h6 class="card-title">
            How do I use the topics and subtopics dropdowns?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            Subtopics are categorized under five broad topics, which represent
            the types of surveys we conduct. Topics are broad and will allow you
            to see the most survey options across these high-level categories
            and the many subtopics within them. Subtopics are very specific and
            allow you to see which primary topics a subtopic can be found
            in.When selecting the same topic and subtopic choices, the order you
            select them in should yield the same results when both topic and
            subtopic are selected, but depending on the research needs and
            interests, it may be helpful to select one method or the other. To
            use the Census Survey Explorer by subtopic or topic,select your
            choice(s) in the subtopic dropdowns or type into the search bar to
            find the survey(s) that has your subject matter of interest. See
            <a href="topics.html">Topics and Subtopics</a> for more guidance.
          </p>

          <h6 class="card-title">
            What do I do if I don’t see the geography I need in the dropdown?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            There are many geographies, if you cannot find your geography,
            select “Other” and try to use other filters, such as topic and
            subtopics, to narrow your search. See the
            <a href="geo.html">geography guidance page</a> what geographies
            were included under “Other” (for example, Tract, Block, School
            District, etc.)
          </p>

          <h6 class="card-title">
            Why can't I find data for all the years of a survey?
          </h6>
          <p class="card-text">
            Some surveys have been changed or combined into other program areas
            over time and therefore, only the most recent data is available.
