The Census Bureau defines ZCTAs by allocating each block that contains addresses to a single ZCTA, usually to the ZCTA that reflects the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses within that tabulation block. Blocks that do not contain addresses but are completely surrounded by a single ZCTA (enclaves) are assigned to the surrounding ZCTA; those surrounded by multiple ZCTAs will be added to a single ZCTA based on limited buffering performed between multiple ZCTAs. The Census Bureau identifies five-digit ZCTAs using a five-character numeric code that represents the most frequently occurring USPS ZIP Code within that ZCTA, and this code may contain leading zeros.</p> </div> </div> <div class=\"card mb-3\"> <div class=\"card-body\"> <h5 class=\"card-title\">Census Tract</h5> <p class=\"card-text\">A small, relatively permanent statistical subdivision of a county in a metropolitan area (MA) or a selected nonmetropolitan county, delineated by a local committee of census data users (a CSAC) for the purpose of presenting decennial census data. Census tract boundaries normally follow visible features, but may follow governmental unit boundaries and other nonvisible features in some instances; they always nest within counties. Glossary G-11 Designed to be relatively homogeneous units with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions at the time the CSAC established them, census tracts usually contain between 2,500 and 8,000 inhabitants. They may be split by any subcounty geographic entity.

A BG consists of all blocks whose numbers begin with the same digit in a given census tract or BNA; for example, BG 3 within a census tract or BNA includes all blocks numbered between 301 and 399. The BG is the lowest level of geography for which the Census Bureau has tabulated sample data in the 1990 census; it was used to tabulate sample data in the 1970 and 1980 censuses only for those areas that had block numbers.

The Island Areas (which include Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) are also recognized as State equivalents in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/economic-census/about/island-areas.html\">Economic Census of Island Areas.</a> Statistics for the Island Areas are not included in U.S. totals.</p> <h6 class=\"card-title\">Selected Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA&rsquo;s )</h6> <p class=\"card-text\">A geographic entity, defined by the Federal OMB for use by Federal statistical agencies, based on the concept of a core area with a large population nucleus, plus adjacent communities having a high degree of economic and social integration with that core. Qualification of an MSA requires the presence of a city with 50,000 or more inhabitants, or the presence of a UA and a total population of at least 100,000 (75,000 in New England). The county or counties containing the largest city and surrounding densely settled territory are central counties of the MSA. Additional outlying counties qualify to be included in the MSA by meeting certain other criteria of metropolitan character, such as a specified minimum population density or percentage of the population that is urban. MSAs in New England are defined in terms of cities and towns, following rules concerning commuting and population density. MSAs were first defined and effective June 30, 1983.
